# Implement User Story

Implement the provided user story by writing production code and tests that satisfy all acceptance criteria, following the project's conventions and architecture.

---

## The Job

1. Read the **user story** and its **acceptance criteria** carefully.
2. Review the **project context** to understand conventions, tech stack, testing strategy, and module structure.
3. Plan the implementation: identify which files to create or modify, what tests to write, and how the change fits into the existing architecture.
4. Implement the user story:
   - Write production code that satisfies every acceptance criterion.
   - Write tests that verify each acceptance criterion (follow the testing strategy from the project context).
   - Follow all naming conventions, code standards, and forbidden patterns from the project context.
5. Verify your work:
   - Ensure the code compiles / type-checks without errors.
   - Run any quality checks defined in the project context.
   - Fix any issues before finishing.
6. Do **not** commit — the calling command handles git commits.

## Inputs

| Source | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| `user_story` (context variable) | The user story JSON with id, title, description, and acceptanceCriteria |
| `project_context` (context variable) | Project conventions, tech stack, code standards, testing strategy, and architecture |
| `iteration` (context variable) | Current iteration number for file naming and context |

## UI / Frontend Stories

Before implementation, detect whether this is a UI task.

- Consider it a UI task when the user story description or acceptance criteria contain keywords such as: `UI`, `interface`, `page`, `component`, `visual`, `button`, `form`, `layout`, `style`, or `frontend`.
- If it is a UI task, apply these Impeccable skills in this exact order before finishing implementation:
  1. `frontend-design` — set design direction and aesthetics.
  2. `harden` — handle UI edge cases and resilience.
  3. `polish` — run a final quality and refinement pass.
- Use these skills as guidance for the implementation you are already making in this story. Do not edit the Impeccable skill files themselves.

## Rules

- **One story at a time.** Implement only the user story provided — do not implement other stories or make unrelated changes.
- **Follow conventions exactly.** Use the naming, formatting, error handling, and module organisation patterns from the project context.
- **Test every acceptance criterion.** Each AC should have at least one corresponding test assertion.
- **No new dependencies** unless the acceptance criteria explicitly require them.
- **Do not modify state files.** Do not touch `.agents/state.json` or progress files — the calling command manages those.
- **Do not commit.** The calling command will commit after verifying quality checks pass.
- **Keep changes minimal.** Only modify files necessary to implement the user story. Do not refactor unrelated code.

## Output

The output is the set of file changes (new files created, existing files modified) in the working tree. There is no document to produce — the code and tests are the deliverable.
